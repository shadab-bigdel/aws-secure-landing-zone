## Project Summary
This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a secure AWS multi-account Landing Zone.
The goal is to apply cloud security best practices, governance guardrails, centralized logging, and identity management using AWS native services and Terraform.

## Architecture Overview
- AWS Organizations
- Security OU / Workload OU / Logging OU
- SCP guardrails
- Centralized CloudTrail + S3 + CloudWatch
- Log Archive account
- Audit / Security account
- Terraform automation (later)

## Technical Objectives
- Define multi-account structure (OU hierarchy)
- Implement mandatory SCPs
- Configure centralized logging architecture
- Define baseline IAM roles
- Prepare Terraform folder structure

## Deliverables
- SCP JSON policy files
- IAM baseline roles JSON
- Terraform modules (bootstrap)
- Architecture diagram
- GitHub repository

## Skills Demonstrated
- AWS Cloud Security Architecture
- Governance and compliance
- IAM strategy & least privilege
- Terraform modular design
- Multi-account controls with AWS Organizations
